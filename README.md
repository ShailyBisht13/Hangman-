Hangman is a classic word-guessing game developed as a fun and educational project that combines logical thinking, vocabulary skills, and interactive gameplay. In this project, the player tries to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts. Each incorrect guess brings the player closer to "completing" the hangman figure, which symbolizes failure if fully drawn.
This project demonstrates the use of basic programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, functions, string manipulation, and user interaction.
How the Game Works -
The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list or user-selected category.
The word is displayed as a series of underscores (_), each representing a letter.
The player inputs one letter per turn.
Correct guesses reveal the letter in its correct position(s).
Incorrect guesses result in a part of the hangman figure being drawn.
The player wins by guessing the complete word before exceeding the maximum number of wrong guesses.
The game ends in a loss if the hangman figure is fully drawn without completing the word.
